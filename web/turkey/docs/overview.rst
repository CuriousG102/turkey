Overview and Inspiration
************************
Creating internal HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk can be programmatically restrictive, and as a result, many
requesters turn to using external HITs as a more flexible alternative. However, creating external HITs can prove
to be a challenge for those who do not know how to code or a redundant chore for those who do. The goal of this
project is to provide a framework that allows for a requester to quickly and easily create external MTurk HITs
with minimal effort thanks to convenient built-in features.

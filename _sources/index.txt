MmmTurkey
=========

Internal HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk can be programmatically restrictive, and as a result, many requesters turn to using external HITs as a more flexible alternative. However, creating such HITs can be redundant and time-consuming. `MmmTurkey <https://github.com/CuriousG102/turkey/>`_ is a framework that enables researchers to not only quickly create and manage external HITs thanks to convenient built-in features, but more significantly also capture and record detailed worker behavioral data characterizing how each worker completes a given task. Though initially designed with Mechanical Turk in mind, MmmTurkey can provide embeddable code to be used on any platform. You can read our paper `here <https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00945>`_.

Developed by `Miles Hudson <github.com/CuriousG102/>`_ and `Brandon Dang <github.com/budang/>`_ under the direction of Dr. `Matthew Lease <https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml/>`_.
